## Overview
This project aims to predict stock values using deep learning techniques. By leveraging historical stock data and various neural network architectures, we attempt to forecast future stock prices accurately.

## Motivation
The stock market is highly volatile and unpredictable, making it challenging for investors to make informed decisions. Deep learning models offer a promising avenue for predicting stock values by capturing complex patterns in the data. This project seeks to explore the effectiveness of such models in forecasting stock prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and normalization of historical stock data.
- Model architecture: Implementation of various deep learning architectures such as LSTM, GRU, and CNN.
- Evaluation metrics: Utilization of metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
- Visualization: Plotting of predicted vs. actual stock values for visualization and analysis.

## Dataset
We utilize historical stock data obtained from reputable financial sources such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The dataset includes features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc., spanning a specific time frame.

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical stock data for the desired company or index.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize features.
3. **Model Training**: Select an appropriate deep learning architecture and train the model on the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics such as MAE and RMSE.
5. **Prediction**: Make predictions on unseen data and visualize the results.

## Results
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in predicting stock values. While no model can perfectly predict stock prices due to market uncertainties, our models show promising results compared to traditional forecasting methods.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate external factors (news sentiment, economic indicators, etc.) for improved prediction accuracy.
- Explore advanced deep learning techniques such as attention mechanisms and transformers.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time stock value prediction.
